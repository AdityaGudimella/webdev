# Web Development

## Introduction

I'm trying to learn web development. I decided to do it in multiple programming languages
simultaneously. I'm going to use this repository to document my progress. I hope it
reads like a book. Please feel free to contribute to this book. It is licensend under
the MIT license.

## Programming languages used in this book

### Python

With the introduction of [PyScript](https://pyscript.net), it is now possible to develop
web applications using purely HTML, CSS and Python (no JavaScript). I'm not sure if this
is a good idea, but I'm going to try it out. I don't know of any books that teach this
(pyscript is still in beta), so I'm going to have to learn it on my own. I'm going to
use the following resources:
